- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kidster3001
- 👀 I’m interested in Gaming, custom keyboards, tweaks, macro hardware and learning new software languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build custom keyboards from scratch, improving with LUA, dipping my toes into C++.  See if VSCode is any better than Notepad++.  Have my doubts...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, sorry....
- 📫 How to reach me -- right here
